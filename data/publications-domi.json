        "abstract": "A Search Join is a join operation which extends a user-provided table with additional attributes based on a large corpus of heterogeneous data originating from the Web or corporate intranets. Search Joins are useful within a wide range of application scenarios: Imagine you are an analyst having a local table describing companies and you want to extend this table with attributes containing the headquarters, turnover, and revenue of each company. Or imagine you are a film enthusiast and want to extend a table describing films with attributes like director, genre, and release date of each film. This article presents the Mannheim Search Join Engine which automatically performs such table extension operations based on a large corpus of Web data. Given a local table, the Mannheim Search Join Engine searches the corpus for additional data describing the entities contained in the input table. The discovered data are joined with the local table and are consolidated using schema matching and data fusion techniques. As a result, the user is presented with an extended table and given the opportunity to examine the provenance of the added data. We evaluate the Mannheim Search Join Engine using heterogeneous data originating from over one million different websites. The data corpus consists of HTML tables, as well as Linked Data and Microdata annotations which are converted into tabular form. Our experiments show that the Mannheim Search Join Engine achieves a coverage close to 100% and a precision of around 90% for the tasks of extending tables describing cities, companies, countries, drugs, books, films, and songs.",

        "abstract": "Millions of HTML tables containing structured data can be found on the Web. With their wide coverage, these tables are potentially very useful for filling missing values and extending cross-domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia, YAGO, or the Google Knowledge Graph. As a prerequisite for being able to use table data for knowledge base extension, the HTML tables need to be matched with the knowledge base, meaning that correspondences between table rows/columns and entities/schema elements of the knowledge base need to be found. This paper presents the T2D gold standard for measuring and comparing the performance of HTML table to knowledge base matching systems. T2D consists of 8 700 schema-level and 26 100 entity-level correspondences between the WebDataCommons Web Tables Corpus and the DBpedia knowledge base. In contrast related work on HTML table to knowledge base matching, the Web Tables Corpus (147 million tables), the knowledge base, as well as the gold standard are publicly available. The gold standard is used afterward to evaluate the performance of T2K Match, an iterative matching method which combines schema and instance matching. T2K Match is designed for the use case of matching large quantities of mostly small and narrow HTML tables against large cross-domain knowledge bases. The evaluation using the T2D gold standard shows that T2K Match discovers table-to-class correspondences with a precision of 94%, row-to-entity correspondences with a precision of 90%, and column-to-property correspondences with a precision of 77%.",

In reality, however, most publishers lack incentives to\r publish the provenance of resources, even if the owner would like such\r information to be published. Currently, it is very intricate to link existing\r resources to new provenance information, either provided by the\r owner or a third party.

OAEI campaigns aim at comparing\r ontology matching systems on precisely defined test cases. These test cases can\r use ontologies of different nature (from simple thesauri to expressive OWL on-\r tologies) and use different modalities, e.g., blind evaluation, open evaluation and\r consensus. OAEI 2013 offered 6 tracks with 8 test cases followed by 23 partici-\r pants. Since 2010, the campaign has been using a new evaluation modality which\r provides more automation to the evaluation. This paper is an overall presentation\r of the OAEI 2013 campaign.",

Often, links between these\r resources are not explicitly available which complicates the search for\r previous research. In this paper, we propose a pattern induction method\r for the detection of study references in full texts. Since these references\r are not specified in a standardized way and may occur inside a variety of\r different contexts ? i.e., captions, footnotes, or continuous text ? our algo-rithm is required to induce very flexible patterns. To overcome the sparse\r distribution of training instances, we induce patterns iteratively using a\r bootstrapping approach. We show that our method achieves promising\r results for the automatic identification of data references and is a first\r step towards building an integrated information system",

Wir unterscheiden \r server- und clientseitige Anreicherungen und zeigen die jeweiligen Vor- und \r Nachteile. Dabei gehen wir insbesondere auf die clientseitige Anreicherung ein, die \r minimal-invasiv umgesetzt werden kann und nur einen geringen Aufwand bedeutet. \r Des Weiteren zeigen wir, dass sich auch damit alle Anforderungen, die sich in \r unserem konkreten Anwendungsfall ergeben, erfüllen lassen.",

In the last years, a larger number of sophisticated ontology matching tools\r for generating such mappings has been developed. The quality of the mappings\r provided by those tools typically depends on the settings of the tools? parameters. As this is a non-trivial task for an end user, we propose the ECOMatch\r approach, which asks the user to provide example mappings instead of parameter settings, and automatically determines a suitable parameter setting based on\r those examples. We show how the preliminary result quality of ontology mappings can be improved by applying automatic, example-based con?guration of\r ontology matching tools.",
