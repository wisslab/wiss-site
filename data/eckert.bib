  abstract = {This paper outlines a proposal for a PhD thesis. The goal is the development
	of a new methodology to supervise and assess a thesaurus based automatic
	indexing process in a document retrieval system. Similar to existing
	approaches for semi-automatic indexing, where automatic annotations
	are only used as preliminary result and hint for a human indexer,
	the approach presented herein relies on a human expert to supervise
	the automatic indexer. The methodology consists of new analysis methods
	combined with advanced visualization techniques and enables the human
	expert to identify concrete problems in a given environment of a
	document base, a thesaurus and an indexer. We present the background
	for the thesis that forms the basis for the problem definition. After
	a review of the current state of the art, our approach and the research
	methodology are described. The current status of our work is presented,
	together with the results of a proof of concept study that has been
	done as one of the first steps.},

  abstract = {Despite serious research efforts, automatic ontology matching still
	suffers from severe problems with respect to the quality of matching
	results. Existing matching systems trade-off precision and recall
	and have their specific strengths and weaknesses. This leads to problems
	when the right matcher for a given task has to be selected. In this
	paper, we present a method for improving matching results by not
	choosing a specific matcher but applying machine learning techniques
	on an ensemble of matchers. Hereby we learn rules for the correctness
	of a correspondence based on the output of different matchers and
	additional information about the nature of the elements to be matched,
	thus leveraging the weaknesses of an individual matcher. We show
	that our method always performs significantly better than the median
	of the matchers used and in most cases outperforms the best matcher
	with an optimal threshold for a given pair of ontologies. As a side
	product of our experiments, we discovered that the majority vote
	is a simple but powerful heuristic for combining matchers that almost
	reaches the quality of our learning results.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods for automated document indexing are becoming an
	alternative to the manual assignment of keywords. We argue that the
	quality of the thesaurus used as a basis for indexing in regard to
	its ability to adequately cover the contents to be indexed and as
	a basis for the specific indexing method used is of crucial importance
	in automatic indexing. We present an interactive tool for thesaurus
	evaluation that is based on a combination of statistical measures
	and appropriate visualisation techniques that supports the detection
	of potential problems in a thesaurus. We describe the methods used
	and show that the tool supports the detection and correction of errors,
	leading to a better indexing result.},
