	of a new methodology to supervise and assess a thesaurus based automatic
	indexing process in a document retrieval system. Similar to existing
	approaches for semi-automatic indexing, where automatic annotations
	are only used as preliminary result and hint for a human indexer,
	the approach presented herein relies on a human expert to supervise
	the automatic indexer. The methodology consists of new analysis methods
	combined with advanced visualization techniques and enables the human
	expert to identify concrete problems in a given environment of a
	document base, a thesaurus and an indexer. We present the background
	for the thesis that forms the basis for the problem definition. After
	a review of the current state of the art, our approach and the research
	methodology are described. The current status of our work is presented,
	together with the results of a proof of concept study that has been
	done as one of the first steps.},

	suffers from severe problems with respect to the quality of matching
	results. Existing matching systems trade-off precision and recall
	and have their specific strengths and weaknesses. This leads to problems
	when the right matcher for a given task has to be selected. In this
	paper, we present a method for improving matching results by not
	choosing a specific matcher but applying machine learning techniques
	on an ensemble of matchers. Hereby we learn rules for the correctness
	of a correspondence based on the output of different matchers and
	additional information about the nature of the elements to be matched,
	thus leveraging the weaknesses of an individual matcher. We show
	that our method always performs significantly better than the median
	of the matchers used and in most cases outperforms the best matcher
	with an optimal threshold for a given pair of ontologies. As a side
	product of our experiments, we discovered that the majority vote
	is a simple but powerful heuristic for combining matchers that almost
	reaches the quality of our learning results.},

  abstract  = {JudaicaLink is a novel domain-specific knowledge base for Jewish culture, history, and studies. JudaicaLink is built by extracting structured, multilingual knowledge from different sources and it is mainly used for contextualization and entity linking. One of the main challenges in the process of aggregating Jewish digital resources is the use of the Hebrew script. The proof of materials in German central cataloging systems is based on the conversion of the original script of the publication into the Latin script, known as Romanization. Many of our datasets, especially those from library catalogs, contain Hebrew authors' names and titles which are only in Latin script without their Hebrew script. Therefore, it is not possible to identify them in and link them to other corresponding Hebrew resources. To overcome this problem, we designed a reverse-transliteration model which reconstructs the Hebrew script from the Romanization and consequently makes the entities more accessible.},

  abstract  = {Cyberbullying is a disturbing online misbehaviour with troubling consequences. It appears in different forms, and in most of the social networks, it is in textual format. Automatic detection of such incidents requires intelligent systems. Most of the existing studies have approached this problem with conventional machine learning models and the majority of the developed models in these studies are adaptable to a single social network at a time. Recently deep learning based models have been used for similar objectives, claiming that they can overcome the limitations of the conventional models, and improve the detection performance. In this paper, we investigated the findings of a recent literature in this regard and validated their findings using the same datasets as they did. We further expanded the work by applying the developed methods on a new dataset. We aimed to further investigate the performance of the models in new social media platforms. Our findings show that the deep learning based models outperform the machine learning models previously applied to the same dataset. We believe that the deep learning based models can also benefit from integrating other sources of information and looking into the impact of profile information of the users in social networks.},

	abstract = {The Resource Description Framework is well-established as a lingua franca for data modeling and is designed to integrate heterogeneous data at instance and schema level using statements. While RDF is conceptually simple, data models nevertheless get complex, when complex data needs to be represented. Additional levels of indirection with intermediate resources instead of simple properties lead to higher barriers for prospective users of the data. Based on three patterns, we argue that shifting information to a meta-level can not only be used to (1) provide provenance information, but can also help to (2) maintain backwards compatibility for existing models, and to (3) reduce the complexity of a data model. There are, however, multiple ways in RDF to use a meta-level, i.e., to provide additional statements about statements. With Named Graphs, there exists a well-established mechanism to describe groups of statements. Since its inception, however, it has been hard to make statements about single statements. With the introduction of RDF-star, a new way to provide data about single statements is now available. We show that the combination of RDF-star and Named Graphs is a viable solution to express data on a meta-level and propose that this meta-level should be used as first class citizen in data modeling.},
