# Prof. Dr. Kai Eckert

*Professor for Artificial Intelligence, Mannheim University of Applied Sciences*

## Change of affiliation

**Since March 1st, 2023, I am Professor for Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hs-mannheim.de) at Mannheim University of Applied Sciences.** 

## Contact
- **Office:** Paul-Wittsack-Str. 10, 68163 Mannheim, Building A, Room 113c.
- **Office hours (for students):** Upon request
  *If no suitable slots are available or outside lecture time, please write an email.*

## Mail policy
Like many, I unfortunately face an increasing amount of incoming email. The following information might be helpful to improve communication:

- Notification of absence: In lectures where attendance is required, you have to notify me if you canâ€™t attend. Generally, I do not answer these emails. Consider yourself excused, if you do not hear otherwise.
- Almost any question about a lecture, besides *very* personal ones, should be posted in the respective Moodle forum. Rule of thumb: if in doubt, use Moodle.
- Occasionally, mails "slip through" if I do not answer them immediately and when they get out of sight due to many new mails. If you got no response after three work days and need one urgently, it is ok and even advisable to send me a reminder.
- Email is not a chat. I usually check my emails once a day, often in the morning. So do not expect an immediate response. Depending on how unfortunate your email arrives with respect to me checking mails, you can expect an answer within up to 48 hours. If not, see above. Usually, however, it should be at the next day, latest.
